# The T
My first ever Unity 3D game. I tested a lot of stuff there, like

- Inventory
- Terrain, trees, 3D enviroment
- Character controller & physics
- etc.

Very old game project! Created somewhere in 2016. The first version, that I found was Unity `5.6.7f1` but it is not the first version of this project 0_0 

I will refactor this code someday & upload an update
